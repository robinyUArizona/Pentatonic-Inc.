# Pentatonic-Inc.
**Problem:** You work for the fictive electronic company called Pentatonic specialized into selling high-end televisions. One day, your manager comes to you and ask you to build a model in order to identify potential future TV buyers. Interestingly, the company has access to the data of thousands customers and wants to prepare a marketing campaign toward the clients of the company Meridian that was just purchased by Pentatonic. Can you help your manager? The data set comes into two different files. You can do anything you want with it just as long as you can build an awesome predictive model. What are the most important desired characteristics of a potential customer? Who will less likely respond to the campaign? You have 11 days to come up with a solution.
