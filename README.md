# Pentatonic-Inc.
Problem: You work for the fictive electronic company called Pentatonic specialized into selling
high-end televisions. One day, your manager comes to you and ask you to build a model in
order to identify potential future buyers. Interestingly, the company has access to the data of
thousands customers and wants to prepare a marketing campaign toward the clients of the
company Meridian that was just purchased by Pentatonic.
